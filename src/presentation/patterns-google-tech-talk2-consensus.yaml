        title: "Introduction to Consensus"
        bullets:
          - "Distributed systems require nodes to agree on shared state"
          - "We will use the term 'agreement to execute a request' and not 'agreement on a value'"
          - "A request can be 'register a lease', 'increment a counter', 'hold a lock' or simply 'write a value' etc."
          - "Network failures and node crashes make agreement challenging" 
          - "Simple replication approaches lead to inconsistent states"
        notes: "Emphasize that consensus is not just about getting and setting key-value pairs, but about maintaining consistency in the face of failures. This sets up the motivation for the following diagrams."

        bullets:
          - "When server is healthy, all requests are processed"
          - "Single point of failure: When the only server fails, all clients are affected"
        notes: "Point out how a single point of failure affects availability. This motivates the need for clustering, which we'll see in the next slides."

        title: "Consensus: Ensuring Consistency in Clustered Environments"
        diagramRef: "cluster_as_single_node"
        bullets:
          - "The cluster appears as a single entity to clients"
          - "Even with node failures, the cluster continues to function"
          - "But how do we ensure internal consistency?"
        notes: "Introduce the concept that clustering solves availability but creates new challenges around consistency."

        title: "How to size a cluster for dynamic failures"
        bullets:
          - "When sizing a cluster, the worst case is not static failure (f nodes down forever)"
          - "The true worst case is 'dynamic failure' or a 'sliding window' of failure"
          - "The set of failed nodes can change completely between operations"
        notes: "This is the core problem we must solve. We aren't just tolerating 'f' failures, we are tolerating 'any f' failures, at any time."

        diagramRef: "quorum_intersection"
        bullets:
          - "Let N = Total Nodes, W = Write Quorum, R = Read Quorum"
          - "Safety demands that any Read Quorum MUST intersect with any Write Quorum"
          - "This ensures a read always sees the latest committed write"
          - "The Rule: W + R > N"
        notes: "This is the fundamental safety guarantee. Use a Venn diagram to show two overlapping circles (W and R) inside a box (N). The overlap is the 'witness' node."

        title: "The Liveness Requirement: Tolerating 'f' Failures"
        bullets:
          - "To stay available, the system must tolerate up to 'f' failures"
          - "A Write must succeed even if 'f' nodes are down"
          - "A Read must also succeed even if 'f' nodes are down"
        notes: "These are the rules for liveness. We must be able to form a quorum from the N-f surviving nodes."

        title: "Deriving the Minimum Cluster Size"
        bullets:
          - "We must satisfy both rules at the same time, even in the worst case"
          - "1. Safety Rule: W + R > N"
          - "2. Liveness Rule: Use the maximum size for W and R to tolerate 'f' failures"
          - "Substitute Liveness (N-f) into Safety: (N - f) + (N - f) > N"
          - "2N - 2f > N  =>  N > 2f"
        notes: "This is the 'Aha!' moment. We combine safety and liveness to find that N must be strictly greater than 2f."

      - type: "text"
        title: "The Solution: N = 2f + 1"
        bullets:
          - "Since N must be an integer, the minimal cluster size is N = 2f + 1"
          - "This is the familiar 'Majority Quorum' rule"
          - "Why it works: It guarantees at least one 'witness' node overlaps between any write and any read"
        notes: "This is the famous answer. N=3 for f=1. N=5 for f=2. This is why we use odd numbers."

          - "Now we need a protocol to coordinate updates across this majority."
          - "Why is this difficult? Why can't we just 'write to the majority'?"
          - "Let's analyze the failure modes of simple protocols."
        notes: "Bridge the gap between the static requirement (cluster size) and the dynamic requirement (protocol). We need to show that having the right hardware/cluster size isn't enough; the software logic matters."
