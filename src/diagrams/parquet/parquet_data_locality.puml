  2. Rack-local (same rack)

note bottom of NodeC
  **Local Reads (Optimal):**
  • Zero network traffic for data
  • Only metadata and results over network
  • Maximum I/O throughput
  
  **Remote Reads (Fallback):**
  • Data transfer over network
  • Replica selection for minimum hops
  • Bandwidth and latency overhead
end note
' [/step6]

' [step7 {"name":"Performance Metrics"}]
note bottom
  **Performance Impact:**
  • Local reads: ~200-500 MB/s (disk speed)
  • Network reads: ~10-100 MB/s (network speed)
  • 2-5x performance difference
  • CPU cycles saved on network processing
