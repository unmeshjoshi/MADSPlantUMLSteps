title Throughput vs Arrival Rate Performance Curve

' Create a simple graph representation using participants and notes
participant "Low Load\n(p < 0.7)" as low
participant "Approaching Saturation\n(p = 0.7-0.9)" as medium  
participant "At Saturation\n(p = 1.0)" as saturation
participant "Beyond Saturation\n(p > 1.0)" as overload

note over low, overload
  **System Throughput Behavior**
end note

note over low
  **Phase 1: Linear Growth**
  • Throughput = Arrival Rate
  • System easily handles load
  • No queuing delays
  • Performance predictable
end note

note over medium
  **Phase 2: Approaching Limit**
  • Throughput still increases
  • Minor queuing begins
  • Performance starts to vary
  • Getting close to capacity mu
end note

note over saturation
  **Phase 3: Maximum Capacity**
  • Throughput plateaus at mu
  • Maximum theoretical limit
  • Queues grow significantly
  • Latency increases sharply
end note

note over overload
  **Phase 4: Degradation**
  • Throughput may decline
  • System overhead increases
  • Request drops/timeouts
  • Unstable performance
end note

' Show the progression with arrows
low ->> medium : Arrival Rate Increases
medium ->> saturation : Reaching Service Rate mu
saturation ->> overload : Exceeding Capacity

' Add mathematical annotations

  **Key Formula: p = lambda / mu**
  
  p < 1: Stable operation
  p = 1: At capacity limit  
  p > 1: Overloaded system
end note
