' [step6 {"name":"Split Vote Scenario", "newPage":"true"}]
note as split_vote
**What if there's a split vote?**

**Scenario:** Athens and Byzantium both timeout simultaneously

1. **Athens:** Requests votes for term=3
2. **Byzantium:** Requests votes for term=3  
3. **Cyrene:** Votes for whoever asks first (say Athens)
4. **Result:** Athens gets 2 votes, Byzantium gets 1 vote
5. **Athens wins** and becomes leader

**If truly simultaneous:**
- Each candidate votes for itself
- Cyrene votes for one of them
- Winner gets 2 votes, loser gets 1 vote
- Random timeouts prevent repeated ties

' [step7 {"name":"Raft vs Paxos Comparison", "newPage":"true"}]
note as comparison
**Raft vs Paxos Leader Election**

**Key Differences:**
• Complexity: Raft (Simple) vs Paxos (Complex)
• Phases: Raft (1 RequestVote) vs Paxos (2 Prepare + Accept)
• Terms/Ballots: Raft (Monotonic) vs Paxos (Arbitrary)
• Split brain: Raft (Impossible) vs Paxos (Possible without care)
• Understandability: Raft (High) vs Paxos (Low)

**Raft Advantages:**
✓ Simpler to understand and implement
✓ Strong leader model eliminates many edge cases
✓ Clear separation of concerns (election vs replication)

**Paxos Advantages:**
✓ More flexible (multiple proposers)
✓ Better theoretical foundation
✓ Can handle more complex scenarios
