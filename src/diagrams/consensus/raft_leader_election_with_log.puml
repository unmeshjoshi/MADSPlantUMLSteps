' [step1 {"name":"Initial State"}]
note over athens: **Athens Log:**\nTerm 3: [1:Inc, 2:Dec]\nLast: (term=3, index=2)

note over byzantium: **Byzantium Log:**\nTerm 3: [1:Inc, 2:Dec, 3:Add]\nLast: (term=3, index=3)

note over cyrene: **Cyrene Log:**\nTerm 2: [1:Inc]\nLast: (term=2, index=1)

note across #lightblue
**Step 1: Initial State**

All nodes have logs with different states.

No current leader exists.
end note
' [/step1]

' [step2 {"name":"Election Timeout", "newPage":"true"}]
note over byzantium #orange: **Election timeout!**\nBecome candidate for term 4\nNote: Byzantium HAS the most up-to-date log

byzantium -> athens: RequestVote(term=4, candidateId=Byzantium,\nlastLogTerm=3, lastLogIndex=3)
byzantium -> cyrene: RequestVote(term=4, candidateId=Byzantium,\nlastLogTerm=3, lastLogIndex=3)

note over byzantium: **Vote Request includes:**\n• Current term (4)\n• Last log term (3)\n• Last log index (3) ← Most recent

note across #lightyellow
**Step 2: Election Timeout**

Byzantium times out and starts election.
Byzantium HAS the most up-to-date log.
This demonstrates RAFT's optimization.
end note
' [/step2]

' [step3 {"name":"Log Comparison and Acceptance", "newPage":"true"}]
note over athens #lightblue: **Log Comparison:**\nByzantium: (term=3, index=3)\nSelf:      (term=3, index=2)\n\nIndex 3 > 2, so Byzantium is more recent

athens -> byzantium: VoteReply(term=4, voteGranted=true)
note over athens: "I'll vote for Byzantium\nbecause its log is more up-to-date"

note over cyrene: **Log Comparison:**\nByzantium: (term=3, index=3)\nSelf:      (term=2, index=1)\n\nTerm 3 > 2, so Byzantium is much more recent

cyrene -> byzantium: VoteReply(term=4, voteGranted=true)

note across #lightgreen
**Step 3: Log Comparison and Acceptance**

Both Athens and Cyrene accept Byzantium.
Byzantium has the most up-to-date log.
RAFT's "at least as up-to-date" rule works!
end note
' [/step3]

' [step4 {"name":"Byzantium Wins Election", "newPage":"true"}]

note over byzantium: **Byzantium becomes leader for term 4**\nHas the most recent log already\nNo recovery queries needed

note across #lightgreen
**Step 4: Byzantium Wins Election**

Byzantium gets unanimous votes.

This is RAFT's key optimization.
end note

end note
' [/step5]

' [step6 {"name":"Client Request Processing", "newPage":"true"}]
client -> byzantium: New request: SetCounter(5)

note over byzantium: **Direct processing:**\n• I already have latest log\n• No recovery overhead\n• Can immediately append new entry

byzantium -> athens: AppendEntries(term=4, entries=[4:SetCounter(5)])
byzantium -> cyrene: AppendEntries(term=4, entries=[4:SetCounter(5)])

note across #lightgreen
**Step 6: Client Request Processing**

Byzantium immediately processes client request.
Uses AppendEntries to replicate to followers.
Much faster than Multi-Paxos recovery.
end note
' [/step6]
