' [step6 {"name":"Benefits of Random Timeouts", "newPage":"true"}]
note across #lightblue
**Random Timeout Benefits for Consensus:**

**Livelock Prevention:**
• Different servers timeout at different times
• Reduces simultaneous leader election attempts
• First server to timeout has advantage

**Election Efficiency:**
• Server with shortest timeout likely becomes leader
• Fewer competing proposals
• Faster convergence to new leader

**Timeout Range Guidelines:**
• Base timeout: 3-5 × heartbeat interval
• Random jitter: ±20% of base timeout
• Example: Base=3s, Range=2.4s-3.6s
• Ensure minimum > 2 × heartbeat interval

**Implementation Notes:**
• Each server picks random timeout on startup
• Timeout recomputed after each leader election
• Balance: detection speed vs. false positives
• Consider network conditions and load
