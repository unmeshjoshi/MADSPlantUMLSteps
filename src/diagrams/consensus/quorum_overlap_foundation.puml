Round 1 Result: IncrementCounter accepted by majority

hnote over Cyrene, Ephesus #lightgreen
**Round 2 Majority Quorum**
Cyrene + Delphi + Ephesus

note over Athens, Byzantium #lightCoral
Not part of Round 2 majority
Status: UNREACHABLE
end note

note over Cyrene #yellow
Accept: IncrementCounter
Generation: 3
Status: ACCEPTED
**OVERLAP NODE**
Knows about Round 1!

New leader candidate
Running recovery phase

Part of Round 2 majority
No previous requests
Status: NONE

' [step3 {"name":"Recovery Query Reveals Overlap Information", "newPage":"true"}]

Delphi -> Cyrene: prepare(Generation=5)
Delphi -> Ephesus: prepare(Generation=5)

Cyrene -> Delphi: promise(Generation=5, accepted="IncrementCounter", Generation=3)
Ephesus -> Delphi: promise(Generation=5, no_accepted_request)

note over Delphi #lightgreen
**Critical Discovery:**
Cyrene reports IncrementCounter with Generation 3
Must use this request (highest generation rule)
end note

note over Cyrene #yellow
**Overlap Guarantees:**
Even though Athens & Byzantium unreachable,
Cyrene preserves information from Round 1
end note

' [/step3]

' [step4 {"name":"Safety Preserved Through Overlap", "newPage":"true"}]

note over Delphi #lightgreen
Applies highest generation rule:
Re-proposes IncrementCounter
with new Generation 5
end note

Delphi -> Cyrene: accept("IncrementCounter", Generation=5)
Delphi -> Ephesus: accept("IncrementCounter", Generation=5)

Cyrene -> Delphi: accepted
Ephesus -> Delphi: accepted

note across #lightgreen
**Safety Preserved:**
IncrementCounter from Round 1 is preserved
No conflicting request can be committed
Quorum overlap ensures continuity
end note
