    note across #pink: Recovery Protocol Questions:\n\n1. Should oldest request (Alice's) be recovered first?\n  - Maintains temporal order\n  - But how to track request timestamps reliably?\n\n2. Should we use node IDs to break ties?\n  - Athens (ID=1) vs Byzantium (ID=2)\n  - Deterministic but arbitrary\n\n3. How to ensure all nodes make same choice?\n  - Nodes must agree on recovery order\n  - Need stable leader election\n\n4. What if more requests arrive during recovery?\n  - Need to queue new requests\n  - Or reject until system stabilizes

    note over athens: Recovery BLOCKED:\nNeeds clear protocol for\nrequest prioritization
    /note over byzantium: Cannot proceed:\nWaiting for recovery\nprotocol decision
    /note over cyrene: Neutral state:\nReady to accept\nwhatever is chosen
