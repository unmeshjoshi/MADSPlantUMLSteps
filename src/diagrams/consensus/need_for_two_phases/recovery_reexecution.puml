        Safety achieved by re-running two phases:
        1. If request was previously accepted by majority:
           - Athens might have executed the request
           - Re-prepare ensures all live nodes agree to
             execute this request again
           - When Athens rejoins, it will sync with
             majority state
           - This maintains consistency whether Athens
             had executed or not

        2. If request was not previously accepted by majority:
           - Re-prepare gets fresh majority agreement
           - Previous partial execution would have failed
           - No node could have executed without majority
    end note
