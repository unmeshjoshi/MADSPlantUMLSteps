    note over athens #lightblue: **Scenario 1: Request WAS Committed**\n• Previous leader got majority (Byzantium + someone else)\n• IncrementCounter is the committed value\n• Athens must preserve it
    
    note over athens #lightyellow: **Scenario 2: Request was NOT Committed**\n• Previous leader only reached Byzantium\n• IncrementCounter never got majority agreement\n• Athens can ignore it

    note over athens, cyrene: • Athens can only reach majority (2 out of 3 nodes)
    note over athens, cyrene: • Third node might be unreachable due to network partition
    note over athens, cyrene: • Athens doesn't know if IncrementCounter was committed
    note over athens, cyrene: • No way to distinguish committed vs. uncommitted with partial information!
