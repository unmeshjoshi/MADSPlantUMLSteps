    note over athens #pink: **Two Possible Scenarios:**
    
    note over athens #lightblue: **Scenario 1: Request WAS Committed**\n• Previous leader got majority (Byzantium + someone else)\n• IncrementCounter is the committed value\n• Athens must preserve it
    
    note over athens #lightyellow: **Scenario 2: Request was NOT Committed**\n• Previous leader only reached Byzantium\n• IncrementCounter never got majority agreement\n• Athens can ignore it

group #Red "Why Athens Cannot Decide"
    note over athens, cyrene #pink: **The Problem:**
    note over athens, cyrene: • Athens doesn't know who else might have accepted IncrementCounter
    note over athens, cyrene: • Maybe the third node crashed and was replaced
    note over athens, cyrene: • Maybe messages were lost before reaching majority
    note over athens, cyrene: • No way to distinguish committed vs. uncommitted!

group #LightGreen "Safety Requirement"
    note over athens, cyrene: **Critical Safety Rule:**
    note over athens, cyrene: If a value was ever committed,\nit must NEVER be lost or changed
    
    note over athens #pink: **Athens' Dilemma:**\nRisk losing a committed value\nOR\nRisk blocking with an uncommitted value?
