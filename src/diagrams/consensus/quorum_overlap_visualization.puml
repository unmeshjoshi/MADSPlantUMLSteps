**All Possible Majorities (size ≥ 2 out of 3):**

**Majority A:** {Athens, Byzantium}
**Majority B:** {Athens, Cyrene}  
**Majority C:** {Byzantium, Cyrene}
**Majority D:** {Athens, Byzantium, Cyrene}

**Key Property:** Any two majorities must overlap!

**Why Quorum Overlap is Critical:**

1. **Information Propagation:** If a value is accepted by majority A,
   any future majority B will contain at least one node that knows about it.

2. **Safety Guarantee:** No two different values can be committed because
   any two majorities share a node that would detect the conflict.

3. **Recovery Correctness:** During recovery, querying a majority
   guarantees we'll discover any previously committed value.

**Example:** If Athens and Byzantium accept "Value X", then any future
majority must include either Athens or Byzantium, ensuring "Value X"
is discovered during recovery.
