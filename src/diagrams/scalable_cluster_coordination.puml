note right of "Scalable Cluster"
    **Cluster Requirements:** 
    - Cluster operations need to be coordinated.
        - Manage group membership and failure detection.
        - Nodes join and leave the cluster dynamically.
        - One node typically acts as the **controller** to coordinate cluster activities.
