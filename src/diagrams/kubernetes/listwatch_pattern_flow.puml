title ListWatch Pattern Implementation

' [step1 {"name":"Components"}]
participant "Client\n(Controller)" as client
participant "API Server" as api
participant "etcd" as etcd
participant "Watch Connection" as watch
' [/step1]

' [step2 {"name":"Initial List Operation"}]
group #LightBlue "Initial List Operation"
client -> api: LIST /api/v1/pods
api -> etcd: Get all pods
etcd --> api: Pod list + ResourceVersion: 1000
api --> client: Pod list + ResourceVersion: 1000
note right of client
  Client now has:
  - Current state snapshot
  - ResourceVersion baseline
  - Local cache populated
end note
' [/step2]

' [step3 {"name":"Start Watch Operation"}]
group #LightGreen "Start Watch"
client -> api: WATCH /api/v1/pods?resourceVersion=1000
api -> etcd: Start watch from version 1000
etcd --> api: Watch stream established
api --> client: Watch stream ready
activate watch
note right of watch
  Watch connection active
  Waiting for changes...
end note
' [/step3]

' [step4 {"name":"Resource Changes", "newPage":"true"}]
group #LightYellow "Resource Modifications"
actor "User" as user
user -> api: kubectl create pod my-pod
api -> etcd: Store new pod (version 1001)
etcd -> api: ADDED event (pod, version 1001)
api -> watch: Forward ADDED event
watch -> client: ADDED: my-pod (version 1001)
client -> client: Update local cache
' [/step4]

' [step5 {"name":"More Changes"}]
user -> api: kubectl delete pod my-pod
api -> etcd: Delete pod (version 1002)
etcd -> api: DELETED event (pod, version 1002)
api -> watch: Forward DELETED event
watch -> client: DELETED: my-pod (version 1002)
client -> client: Remove from local cache
' [/step5]

' [step6 {"name":"Network Failure", "newPage":"true"}]
group #LightPink "Network Failure Handling"
watch -[#red]X client: Connection lost
deactivate watch
note right of client
  Connection lost!
  Last known version: 1002
end note

client -> client: Detect connection failure
client -> client: Start exponential backoff\n(100ms, 200ms, 400ms...)
' [/step6]

' [step7 {"name":"Reconnection"}]
group #LightCoral "Automatic Reconnection"
client -> api: WATCH /api/v1/pods?resourceVersion=1002
api -> etcd: Resume watch from version 1002
etcd --> api: Watch stream re-established
api --> client: Watch stream ready
activate watch

note right of client
  Reconnected successfully!
  No events missed due to
  resourceVersion tracking
end note

etcd -> api: MODIFIED event (pod-x, version 1003)
api -> watch: Forward MODIFIED event
watch -> client: MODIFIED: pod-x (version 1003)
client -> client: Update local cache
' [/step7]

' [step8 {"name":"Continuous Operation"}]
group #LightGray "Continuous Operation"
note over client, etcd
  ListWatch continues indefinitely:
  - Efficient incremental updates
  - Automatic failure recovery
  - No polling overhead
  - Strong consistency guarantees
end note
