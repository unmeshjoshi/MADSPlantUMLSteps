**Replication Benefits:**
✓ Fault tolerance
✓ Load distribution
✓ Geographic distribution
✓ Faster local reads
end note

note top of "Replicated Servers" #FFE6E6
**Replication Challenges:**
• How to keep copies synchronized?
• What if updates fail on some servers?
• How to handle conflicting updates?
• Performance impact of coordination?
**The Fundamental Trade-off:**
More replicas provide better availability and fault tolerance,
but introduce complexity in maintaining consistency across copies.
