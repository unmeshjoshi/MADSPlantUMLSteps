title The Utilization Constraint: Why U ≤ 1

rectangle "**Utilization Formula**" as Formula #E6F3FF {
  rectangle "**U = X × S**" as Eq1 #FFFFCC
  rectangle "**U = Throughput × Service Time**" as Eq2 #F0F8FF
}

rectangle "**Physical Meaning**" as Meaning #E6FFE6 {
  note as MeaningNote
  **Utilization = Busy Time ÷ Total Time**
  
  U = (Completions ÷ Elapsed) × (Busy ÷ Completions)
  U = Busy Time ÷ Elapsed Time
  
  **Cannot exceed 1.0 (100% busy)**
  end note
}

rectangle "**The Constraint**" as Constraint #FFE6E6 {
  note as ConstraintNote
  **For single server: U = X × S ≤ 1**
  
  This creates the fundamental trade-off:
  • If S is large → X must be small
  • If S is small → X can be large
  
  **Maximum Throughput: X_max = 1/S**
  end note
}

note bottom #FFFFCC
**Example:**
Service time S = 2ms = 0.002s
X_max = 1/0.002 = 500 requests/sec

At X = 400 req/s:
U = 400 × 0.002 = 0.80 (80% utilized)
end note
