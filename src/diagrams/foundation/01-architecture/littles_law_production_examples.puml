title Little's Law in Production Systems

actor Client
participant "Load Balancer" as LB
participant "App Server Pool" as AppPool
database "Database Pool" as DBPool

note over Client, DBPool #E6F3FF
**Little's Law: L = λW**
L = Number in system, λ = Arrival rate, W = Response time
end note

Client -> LB : HTTP Request (λ = 1000 req/s)
activate LB

LB -> AppPool : Route to available server
activate AppPool

note over AppPool #FFFFCC
**Application Layer:**
L = Active HTTP connections
W = Request processing time (50ms)
L = 1000 req/s × 0.05s = 50 connections
end note

AppPool -> DBPool : Database query
activate DBPool

note over DBPool #FFE6E6
**Database Connection Pool:**
L = Active DB connections  
W = Query execution time (5ms)
L = 1000 queries/s × 0.005s = 5 connections
end note

note right of DBPool #F0F8FF
**Saturation Analysis:**
Pool size: 50 connections
Current usage: 5 connections
Utilization: 10% (healthy)

**What if W increases to 100ms?**
L = 1000 × 0.1 = 100 connections
Pool exhausted → system failure
end note

DBPool --> AppPool : Query result
deactivate DBPool

AppPool --> LB : HTTP response
deactivate AppPool

LB --> Client : Response delivered
deactivate LB

note bottom #E6FFE6
**Hockey Stick Saturation Curve:**
• 0-500 users: Flat performance (W = 50ms)
• 500+ users: Queue buildup begins
• 1000+ users: W grows exponentially 
• Result: L = λ × W explodes beyond capacity
