title System Queuing Model: The Core Concepts

rectangle "**Requests Arrive**" as Arrival #E6F3FF {
  note as ArrivalNote
  **Arrival Rate (λ)**
  Requests/second entering system
  end note
}

rectangle "**System Processing**" as System #FFFFCC {
  queue "Queue (Wait)" as Queue #FFE6E6
  rectangle "Server (Processing)" as Server #E6FFE6
  
  Queue -right-> Server
  
  note bottom of Queue
  **Wait Time (Wq)**
  Time spent waiting
  end note
  
  note bottom of Server
  **Service Time (S)**
  Time to process one request
  end note
}

rectangle "**Requests Complete**" as Complete #E6F3FF {
  note as CompleteNote
  **Throughput (X)**
  Completions/second
  end note
}

Arrival --> Queue
Server --> Complete

note as Formula #F0F8FF
**Key Relationships:**
• **L** = Requests in system (waiting + processing)
• **W** = Total time in system (Wq + S)
• **Little's Law**: L = λ × W
• **In system** = Those waiting + Those being processed
end note
