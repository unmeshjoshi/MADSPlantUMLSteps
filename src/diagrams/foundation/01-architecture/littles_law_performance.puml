**Performance Data:**
| Users | Response Time | Throughput |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| 50    | 500ms        | 100 TPS    |
| 100   | 1200ms       | 83 TPS     |
| 200   | 4000ms       | 50 TPS     |

  note as Behavior
**System Characteristics:**
- Flat performance until capacity (~50 users)
- Declining throughput as load increases
- System saturates beyond capacity
- Response time increases exponentially
