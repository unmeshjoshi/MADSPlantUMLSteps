title Throughput vs Number of Users Performance Curve

rectangle "Graph Representation" as Graph {
  note as GraphData #F0F8FF
**Throughput vs Users Curve:**

X-axis: Number of Users (0-3000)
Y-axis: Throughput (0-100)

**Key Performance Points:**
- 0-500 users: Flat at 100 throughput
- 500+ users: Performance decline begins
- 1000 users: ~80 throughput (20% degradation)
- 1500 users: ~70 throughput (30% degradation)
- 2000 users: ~50 throughput (50% degradation)
- 3000 users: ~35 throughput (65% degradation)
  end note
}

note right of Graph #FFE6E6
**System Behavior:**
- Constant performance until saturation
- Graceful degradation under overload
- Demonstrates need for horizontal scaling
- Shows Little's Law in practice
