title WAL Storage Sector Alignment Strategy

note as UnalignedIssue #FFE6E6
**Unaligned Write Problem:**
• 4KB write at offset 256 bytes
• Spans partial sectors (512-byte boundaries)
• Forces expensive Read-Modify-Write cycles
• Storage must read existing data first
• 3x performance penalty
end note

note as AlignedSolution #E6FFE6
**Aligned Write Solution:**
• 4KB write at sector boundary (offset 0)
• Complete sector overwrites only
• No Read-Modify-Write needed
• Direct hardware writes
• 3x performance improvement
end note

note as PaddingStrategy #F0F8FF
**Intelligent Padding Strategy:**
• Add structured padding to reach boundaries
• 4-byte marker + 4-byte length + zeros
• Small overhead (<1%) for massive performance gain
• Recovery tools can identify padding vs corruption
• Essential for WAL optimization
end note

note bottom #FFFFCC
**Storage Fundamentals:**
• Disks write complete 512-byte sectors atomically
• Unaligned writes require expensive merge operations
• Sector alignment eliminates this overhead
• Critical optimization for append-only WAL patterns
end note
