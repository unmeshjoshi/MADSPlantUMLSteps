**Key Characteristics:**
• Multiple processes/servers (3 to thousands)
• Manages data (inherently stateful)
• Message passing communication
• Tolerates partial failures
• Appears as single system to users
end note

Client --> S1 : Single System View
Client --> S2
Client --> S3

**User Perspective:**
Clients see one logical system,
not individual servers
