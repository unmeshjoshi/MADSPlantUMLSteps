title Bridging Theory and Practice with Real Code

rectangle "Pattern Theory" #E6F3FF {
  note as Theory
**Generic Patterns:**
• Broad applicability
• Abstract concepts
• Design principles
• Mathematical foundations
  end note
}

rectangle "Code Implementation" #FFE6E6 {
  note as Code
**Concrete Implementation:**
```java
public class WriteAheadLog {
  private final LogSegment currentSegment;
  private final AtomicLong logIndex;
  
  public void append(LogEntry entry) {
    entry.setIndex(logIndex.incrementAndGet());
    currentSegment.write(entry);
    currentSegment.flush();
  }
}
```
  end note
}

rectangle "Production Systems" #E6FFE6 {
  note as Production
**Real-World Usage:**
• Kafka commit logs
• etcd Raft implementation
• Cassandra commit logs
• PostgreSQL WAL
  end note
}

Theory --> Code : Patterns must be\nspecific enough for\nimplementation
Code --> Production : Real code bridges\ntheory and practice
Theory --> Production : Academic concepts\nbecome operational systems

note bottom #FFFFCC
**Critical for Distributed Systems:**
Academic heritage requires concrete implementations
to validate theoretical concepts in practice.
