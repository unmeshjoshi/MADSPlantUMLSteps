note as FailureStats #FFE6E6
**Monthly Failure Statistics:**
• ~0.5 overheating events (1-2 days recovery)
• ~1 PDU failure (500-1000 machines, 6h recovery)
• ~1 rack move (500-1000 machines, 6h downtime)
• ~1 network rewiring (5% machines, 2-day span)
• ~20 rack failures (40-80 machines, 1-6h recovery)
• ~5 racks with 50% packet loss
• ~8 network maintenances (30-min connectivity issues)
• ~12 router reloads (DNS outages)
• ~3 router failures (1h traffic pull)
• ~1000 individual machine failures
• ~thousands of hard drive failures

**Other Issues:**
- Slow disks, bad memory
- Misconfigured machines
- Flaky hardware behavior
