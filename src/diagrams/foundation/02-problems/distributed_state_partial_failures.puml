title Distributed System = Distributed State + Partial Failures

Users --> AS1 : "<10ms"
Users --> AS2 : "<10ms"
Users --> AS3 : "<10ms"

AS1 --> DB1 : "<2ms"
AS2 -[dashed]-> DB2_failed : Failed
AS3 --> DB3 : "<2ms"

note right of AS2 #FFE6E6
**Partial Failure Scenario:**
- DB2 has failed
- System continues functioning
- AS2 can failover to DB1 or DB3
- No complete system outage
end note

note bottom #E6F3FF
**Core Principle:** System functions as a whole
even when individual components fail.
This is the essence of fault-tolerant distributed systems.
