title Unsynchronized Clocks Problem

rectangle "Server A Environment" {
  rectangle "Clock A" as ClockA
  note bottom of ClockA
  **Server A Clock:**
  10:10 AM
  Drift rate: +2ms/hour
  end note
}

rectangle "Server B Environment" {
  rectangle "Clock B" as ClockB  
  note bottom of ClockB
  **Server B Clock:**
  1:50 PM  
  Drift rate: -3ms/hour
  end note
}

note top of ClockA #FFE6E6
**Clock Synchronization Issues:**
• Time-of-day clocks drift at different rates
• NTP adjustments can cause backward time jumps
• Clocks from different servers cannot be compared
• Network delays affect time synchronization
• Crystal oscillator variations cause drift
end note

rectangle "Distributed System Challenges" #E6F3FF {
  note as Challenges
**Problems Caused:**
• Event ordering becomes ambiguous
• Timeouts may be unreliable
• Log timestamps inconsistent
• Difficulty detecting causality
• Race conditions in distributed algorithms

**Solutions:**
• Logical clocks (Lamport timestamps)
• Vector clocks for causality
• Hybrid logical clocks
• Consensus-based ordering
  end note
}

ClockA --> Challenges
ClockB --> Challenges

note bottom #FFFFCC
**Key Insight:** Never rely on synchronized wall-clock time
for correctness in distributed systems. Use logical ordering instead.
