title Network Delays - Asynchronous Communication Challenge

participant "Server A" as SA
participant "Network" as Network
participant "Server B" as SB

SA -> Network : Send Message
note over Network #FFE6E6
**Unpredictable Delays:**
• No upper bound on delay
• Packets can be lost
• Routes can change
• Congestion varies
• Hardware failures
end note

Network -> SB : Message (delayed)
note right of SB
Message arrives much later
than expected, or not at all
end note

SA -> SA : Timeout?
note over SA #FFFFCC
**Timeout Dilemma:**
• Too short: false failures
• Too long: slow detection
• No way to distinguish:
  - Slow network
  - Failed server
  - Lost message
end note

note over SA
**TCP/IP Characteristics:**
• Best-effort delivery
• No timing guarantees  
• Congestion control adds delays
• Retransmissions cause variability
• Router failures cause rerouting

**Design Implications:**
• Cannot wait indefinitely
• Need failure detection mechanisms
• Risk of split-brain scenarios
• Require consensus algorithms
end note


note over SA #FFE6CC
**Critical Design Principle:** Distributed systems must operate correctly
despite arbitrary network delays and cannot rely on timing assumptions.
