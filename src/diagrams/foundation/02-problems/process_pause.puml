title Process Pause - The Silent Failure Mode

participant "Process" as Process

== Normal Operation ==
Process -> Process : Processing requests
note right : Normal operation

== Pause Event ==
alt Garbage Collection Pause
  GC -> Process : Stop-the-world GC
  note over Process #FFE6E6
  **GC Pause:**
  • 100ms - 10s pause
  • Process unaware of pause
  • All threads suspended
  • Heap cleanup in progress
  end note
  GC -> Process : Resume
else OS Scheduling Delay  
  OS -> Process : Deschedule
  note over Process #FFE6E6
  **Scheduler Delay:**
  • High system load
  • Process not scheduled
  • Can last seconds
  • Process unaware
  end note
  OS -> Process : Reschedule
end

== Impact on Distributed System ==
Process -> Process : Resume processing
note right #FFFFCC
**False Failure Detection:**
• Heartbeats missed during pause
• Other nodes assume failure
• Leader election triggered
• Split-brain risk
end note

== Pause Detection Challenges ==
note over Process #E6F3FF
**Process Cannot Detect Its Own Pause:**
• No awareness of lost time
• Continues as if nothing happened
• May assume others failed
• Clock measurements unreliable during pause

**Mitigation Strategies:**
• Longer heartbeat timeouts
• Multiple failure detection signals
• Lease-based coordination
• External monitoring systems
end note

note bottom #FFE6CC
**Key Challenge:** Process pauses are invisible to the paused process,
making them particularly dangerous for distributed system correctness.
