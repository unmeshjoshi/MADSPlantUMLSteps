  **Locality Preferences:**
  1. Node-local (same node)
  2. Rack-local (same rack)
  3. Off-rack (different rack)
end note

' [step4 {"name":"Optimal Task Assignment", "newPage":"true"}]
note top
**Optimal Task Assignment (Local Reads):**

Task Scheduler assigns:
• Task 1 → Executor A: Process RG1 (Local read from Block 1)
• Task 2 → Executor B: Process RG2 (Local read from Block 2)  
• Task 3 → Executor C: Process RG3 (Local read from Block 3)

All executors read data locally from their respective nodes.
end note
' [/step4]

' [step5 {"name":"Fallback Scenarios"}]
note top
**Fallback Scenario (Remote Reads):**

When Node C is unavailable:
• Task 1 → Executor A: Process RG1 (Read locally from Block 1) ✓
• Task 2 → Executor B: Process RG2 (Read locally from Block 2) ✓
• Task 3 → Executor A: Process RG3 (Read from replica Block 3)

Uses local replica instead of remote primary copy for better performance.
end note

' [step6 {"name":"Network Traffic Analysis"}]
note bottom
**Local Reads (Optimal):**
• Zero network traffic for data
• Only metadata and results over network
• Maximum I/O throughput

**Remote Reads (Fallback):**
• Data transfer over network
• Replica selection for minimum hops
• Bandwidth and latency overhead
end note
' [/step6]

' [step7 {"name":"Performance Metrics"}]
note bottom
  **Performance Impact:**
  • Local reads: ~200-500 MB/s (disk speed)
  • Network reads: ~10-100 MB/s (network speed)
  • 2-5x performance difference
  • CPU cycles saved on network processing
