title Database Scaling Bottlenecks

package "Enterprise Database Server" {
    component [B+Tree Engine] as BTree
    component [Page Cache] as Cache
    component [Transaction Log] as TxLog
    component [Lock Manager] as Locks
}

package "Storage Layer" {
    component [File System] as FS
    component [Storage Device] as Storage
    note top of Storage : **60K+ IOPS Required**\nfor real-time operations
}

package "Concurrent Access" {
    actor "User 1...500" as Users
    note top of Users : **500+ Concurrent Users**\ncompeting for resources
}

package "Data Volume" {
    database "Database Files" as DB
    note top of DB : **10TB+ per server**\nbefore sharding needed
}

Users --> BTree : Point Queries
BTree --> Cache : Page Access
BTree --> Locks : Concurrent Control
Cache --> FS : Page Faults
FS --> Storage : I/O Operations
TxLog --> Storage : Write Operations
Storage --> DB : Physical Storage

note as N1
**Performance Cliff at Scale:**
• 500+ users → Lock contention
• 60K+ IOPS → Storage saturation  
• 10TB+ → Single machine limits
end note
