    bullets:
      - "Consensus is fundamental to distributed systems"
      - "Key challenges in achieving agreement"
      - "Understanding the need for two-phase protocols"
    notes: "Emphasize that consensus is not just about agreement, but about maintaining consistency in the face of failures. This sets up the motivation for the following diagrams."

    diagramRef: "single_server_problem"
    bullets:
      - "Consider a single server. It cannot handle failures."
    notes: "Point out how a single point of failure affects availability. This motivates the need for clustering, which we'll see in the next slides."
